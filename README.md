# Team Shift Scheduler

### About the Project

This project is a **Team Shift Scheduler**—a full-stack web app designed to help managers and team members streamline shift assignments. We built this app with Angular on the front end, creating a user-friendly experience that lets admins set up shifts and employees claim them on a first-come, first-serve basis.

### Why We Built It

Our goal was to build an intuitive scheduling app that keeps things simple. Shifts can sometimes feel chaotic, so we wanted a tool that makes the scheduling process easy and transparent for both admins and employees.

### Key Features

- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can create, edit, and delete shifts. They can also manage team members’ accounts.
- **Employee Access**: Employees can view all open shifts and claim available ones in real-time. It’s first-come, first-serve, so it’s fair and straightforward.
- **Personalized Schedules**: Each team member can see their own claimed shifts, making it easy to keep track of what they signed up for.

### Tech Stack

- **Angular** for the front end
- **Backend**: [Your backend choice here, e.g., Node.js with Express or Django]
- **Database**: [Database choice, e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL]

### How It Works

1. **Admins** log in, create shifts, and manage team members.
2. **Employees** log in to see available shifts and claim them.
3. Once claimed, shifts show up in each employee’s personal schedule.

### Project Highlights

- **Built a Responsive UI** with Angular, making the experience smooth on both desktop and mobile.
- **Real-Time Shift Management**: Shifts update dynamically, so employees see openings as they become available.
- **Hands-On Full-Stack Development**: We handled everything from setting up the backend server and database to designing the front-end interface.

### What We Learned

Working on this project taught us a lot about coordinating back-end logic with front-end interactivity, especially in real-time applications. We also gained valuable experience in teamwork and version control, making sure everyone’s contributions fit together smoothly.

### Future Ideas

- **Notifications**: Send reminders to employees for upcoming shifts.
- **Shift Swapping**: Let employees trade shifts if they need to.

### About Our Team

We're a group of students passionate about full-stack development, and we wanted to take on a project that has real-world applications and showcases our technical skills. This app challenged us to think about both user experience and functionality, and we’re proud of what we accomplished.
